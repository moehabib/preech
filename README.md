This is a mini-project that is part of my masters program at university of Birmingham. Preech is a sublime Text 2 plugin that  adds speech based programming functionality to sublime in order to allow programmers to dictate their code. Preech uses CMU sphinx to perform Speech-To-text. The project is still in pre-alpha state and is not yet usable.

How to test it 
=================
- download the entire master repository as a .Zip file by clicking on "zip" above. 
- Unzip the file
- Open your sublime text 2 editor
- Click on preferences > browse packages ...
- copy the folder "preech" into the packages folder
- restart sublime text 2
- click File , you should see the Preech menu there
