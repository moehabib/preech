This is a mini-project that is part of my masters program at university of Birmingham. Preech is a sublime Text 2 plugin that  adds speech based programming functionality to sublime in order to allow programmers to dictate their code. Preech uses CMU sphinx to perform Speech-To-text. The project is still in pre-alpha state and is not yet usable.
